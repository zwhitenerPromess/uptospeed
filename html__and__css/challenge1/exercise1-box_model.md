## CSS Box Model Exercise

Exercises are small challenges or tidbits of information to get familiar with important concepts. Exercises don't need to
be uploaded to github, however, you can if you want to. Go to [codepen](codepen.io) to try out some of the exercises.

An important part in building html components is knowing how to properly size elements. The css box model explains how content,
padding, borders, and margin will affect the size of an html element. For a good explanation check out this article on [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp).
Start a new pen on codepen and make a div with a background color so you can see it. Mess around with the height, width, padding, border,
and margin of the div to see how they change the size of the div.
