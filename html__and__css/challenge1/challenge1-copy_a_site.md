## Copy codecademy's catalog page

You can find the codecademy catalog page [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/all). It doesn't have to look exactly like the codecademy site, but try to get it as close as possible without copying the actual code from the source. It really doesn't even have to be functional. 

The purpose of this challenge is to learn how to use html and css to achieve an intended layout and to be able to replicate designs visually. You should use an external stylesheet and feel free to use a css framework like [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to help with some basic css classes (containers, inline lists, etc.).

Hint: Notice how the codecademy catalog page can visually be broken down into 5 sections: the header, the blue banner section, the white section with tabs, the tile section where all the courses are shown, and the footer. The html should be broken down similarly. Maybe something like this: 

```html

<head>
	...
</head>
<body>
	<header>
		...
	</header>
	<section class="banner">
		...
	</section>
	<section class="tabs">
		...
	</section>
	<section class="tiles">
		...
	</section>
	<footer>
		...
	</footer>
</body>


```

If you get stuck, do the html and css tutorials on the codecademy site.
