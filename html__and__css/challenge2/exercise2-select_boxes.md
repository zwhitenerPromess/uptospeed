## Select Boxes Exercise

Select boxes are used pretty often as well in forms. This is a tiny exercise, but checkout a possible use case for a select box: 

```html
<select name="state">
  <option>Alabama</option>
  <option>Alaska</option>
  <!-- other states  -->
  <option>Wyoming</option>
</select>
```
