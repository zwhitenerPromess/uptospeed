## Build a billing form

Pretend you're a developer of an ecommerce store and you need to build a form that would allow the end user to enter their billing info. Your goal
is to create a form that grabs the following information:

* full name
* billing address
* city
* state
* zip code
* country
* payment type (visa, mastercard, etc.)
* card number
* expiration date
* cvv/cvc code (these numbers should be visually protected like a password)

Make the form attractive and intuitive to use. Lay it out in any you would like to.

Don't worry about sending the information anywhere specific. You can just use "#" as the value of the forms action attribute.
