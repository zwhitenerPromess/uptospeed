# Frontend Development Resources and Challenges

The idea of this repository is to provide an array of challenges to aid in the process of getting one up to speed in HTML, CSS, Javascript, es6, and react js. These technologies make up the stack that is used on the frontend for the Promess Controller Cloud. The challenges vary in difficulty, but should take less than a few hours to complete. If you get stuck, search the internet for possible solutions. If that doesn't work, make note of the issue and shoot me an email.

Create your own repository to upload submissions to each challenge. Try to follow the same directory structure as this repository. For example, your directory structure for challenges may look something like this:

```
frontendchallenges
    html__and__css
        challenge1
            index.html
            style.css
        challenge2
            index.html
            style.css
    javascript
